### Style Information

Check out Raymond Hettinger's tips on [writing beautiful python](https://gist.github.com/JeffPaine/6213790).

### Working with files

Use `os.path.realpath()` to elegantly handle command line arguments that might be relative paths.  

`glob.glob('*.txt')` will return a list of text files in the working directory.

Get the filename with `os.path.basename()`.


### Errors!

**ImportError**. Occasionally (if your primary machine account isn't an admin), 
you'll get the dreaded `ImportError: No module named...` when trying to import a package, even
though `pip install` tells you everything is fine. You are probably getting this error because you previously thought it
was necessary to use `sudo` to install the package. To fix this, uninstall the package using `sudo` and reinstall
without `sudo` using the `--user` option. For example:

```bash
su admin
sudo pip uninstall beautifulsoup4

#Switch back to a normal user (one without sudo powers)
pip install --user beautifulsoup4
```

Make sure that you have also added the appropriate package-binary path to your PATH variable as some package need this, e.g., scrapy.

```bash
#Find scrapy
find ~ -name scrapy

#Add that path to your PATH variable (you can also put this in your bash_profile)
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/Library/Python/2.7/bin
```
