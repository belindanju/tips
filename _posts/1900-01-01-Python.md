### Errors!

**ImportError**. Occasionally, you'll get the dreaded `ImportError: No module named...` when trying to import a package, even
though `pip install` tells you everything is fine. You are probably getting this error because you previously thought it
was necessary to use `sudo` to install the package. To fix this, uninstall the package using `sudo` and reinstall
without `sudo` using the `--user` option. For example:

```bash
su admin
sudo pip uninstall beautifulsoup4

#Switch back to a normal user (one without sudo powers)
pip install --user beautifulsoup4
```
